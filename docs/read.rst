Read routines for a ProDiMo Model
*********************************

This module provides several routines to read the output of a ProDiMo model. 
All the data belonging to a a ProDiMo model is put into a hierachical data structure (:class:`prodimopy.read.Data_ProDiMo`).
 

The module provides routines to read "all" data of a ProDiMo model but it is also 
possible to only read certain model data (e.g. only the SED of a model).
