ProDiMo Python
===============

Python package for plotting ProDiMo results.

This is still under development, but you can use it already, if you want. 


Installation
************
Currently the easiest way to use it is to clone this repository and install the package directly from the source:

* click on the Clone link in the menu and copy the git command
* change into a directory of your choice and execute the command
* change into the prodimopy directory and type:

::

  python setup.py develop

This will install the package in your current python environment (should be the one you want to use for ProDiMo). 

Code Update
***********
Simply type 

::

  git pull 

in the prodimopy directory. You can directly use the updated code (no reinstall required).
