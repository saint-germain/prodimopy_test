ProDiMo Python
===============

Python package for plotting ProDiMo results.

This is still under development, but you can use it already, if you want. 


Installation
************
Currently the easiest way to use it is to clone this repository and install the package directly.

* click on the Clone link in the menu and copy the git command
* change into a directory of your choice and execute the command
* change into the prodimopy directory 
* type

```
python setup.py develop
```

This will install the package in your current python environment (should be the one you want to use for ProDiMo). 

Code Update
***********
Simply type 

```
git pull 
```

in the prodimopy directory. Than you can directly use the new code (no reinstall required).
